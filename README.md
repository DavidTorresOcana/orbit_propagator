# orbit_propagator

This is a Simulator and propagator of orbits.

The routines' taks is to calculate all the parameters of planet's satellites and also give a tools for evaluating and design missions (planetary e interplanetary).

This is the product of the first step which works integrating the problem with Battin functions, and the second program integrate using the Keplerian solution and the Euler method.

This is only a toy project made in 2 afternoons.
