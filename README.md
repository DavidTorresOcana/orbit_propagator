# orbit_propagator

Due to public demand, I am releasing this code of Simulator and propagator of orbits implemented while studing the matter.

The routines' taks is to calculate all the parameters of planet's satellites and also give a tools for evaluating and design missions (planetary e interplanetary).

This is the product of the first step which works integrating the problem with Battin functions, and the second program integrate using the Keplerian solution and the Euler method.

This is only a toy project. I made it in 2 afternoons.
